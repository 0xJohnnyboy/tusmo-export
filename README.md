# Tusmo Export
This script extracts the leaderboard data (player names and scores) from tusmo.xyz and generates a CSV file with date and time.

## How to install as a Chrome extension (Developer mode)

Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
(edge://extensions for edge)

Enable Developer mode.

Click Load unpacked and select your folder.

## Usage

When the leaderboard is visible, you can save data by clicking the dedicated button in the popup.
Clicking twice won't duplicate, the issue has been handled.
You can reset stored data at any time.
Also you can now export by month. Date fields only show once you saved data.
